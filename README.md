# Multilingual_Cyberbullying_Detection System


Abstract- Cyberbullying may be a genuine issue that influences numerous individuals online, particularly on
social media stages. Cyberbullying can happen totally different dialects, and it is vital to identify and avoid it in
a multilingual setting. In this paper, we propose a Multilingual Cyberbullying Detection System (MCDS) that
can recognize cyberbullying in five languages: English, Hindi (Hindi and Hindi-English code-mixed), Marathi,
Bengali and Tamil. We utilize a combination of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods
to classify content messages as cyberbullying or not. We evaluate our system on several datasets and achieve high
accuracy and F1-score and Recall. Our System can be amplified to other languages and domains, and can help
to protect clients from online harassment and cyberbullying or abuse. The results of our experiments have shown
an accuracy up-to 95% and F1-score up-to 94%.
